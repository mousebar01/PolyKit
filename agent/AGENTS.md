# PolyKit Agent migration source

This directory is kept as the AgentSession migration source for PolyKit. It is
not a second production Web application: do not mount its Next.js shell or
duplicate its settings in PolyKit. The production entry point is PolyKit's
FastAPI `/agent/*` boundary and its managed Node sidecar in `runtime/server.ts`.

## Quick Start

The copied Next app is not a product service. Use the root PolyKit build and
FastAPI server for runtime verification.

Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`
Lint: `npm run lint`  
**Never run `next build` during dev** — pollutes `.next/` and breaks `npm run dev`.

## Architecture

```
Browser                PolyKit FastAPI             Node Agent sidecar
  │                        │                               │
  ├─ /agent/sessions ──────▶ loopback proxy ───────────────▶ AgentSession
  ├─ /agent/.../commands ──▶ command forwarding ──────────▶ session.send()
  ├─ /agent/.../events ─────▶ SSE forwarding ◀────────────── session events
  │                        │                               │
  └─ workspace/settings ───▶ server-owned paths/state
```

Session browsing uses SDK `SessionManager` helpers and `lib/session-reader.ts`;
message commands use `startRpcSession()` in the managed sidecar.

## Key Design Decisions & Traps

### AgentSession lifecycle (`lib/rpc-manager.ts`)
- One `AgentSessionWrapper` per session id, keyed in `globalThis.__piSessions`
- `globalThis` survives Next.js hot-reload; plain module-level Map does not
- Idle timeout: 10 minutes. Concurrent `startRpcSession()` calls share a single start Promise (`globalThis.__piStartLocks`)

### Fork must destroy the wrapper immediately
`AgentSession.fork()` **mutates the wrapper's inner state in-place** — after fork, `inner.sessionId` is the *new* session's id. If the wrapper stays alive in the registry under the old id, the next request gets the already-forked state and subsequent forks produce a corrupt `parentSession` chain.

**Fix**: `send("fork")` captures `newSessionId`, then calls `this.destroy()` before returning. The next request for the original session reloads a clean AgentSession from the original file.

### Two kinds of branching — don't confuse them
- **Fork** (Fork button on user message): creates a new independent `.jsonl` file. Shown as a child in the sidebar tree via `parentSession` header field.
- **In-session branch** (Continue button / BranchNavigator): calls `navigate_tree` within the same file. Multiple entries share the same `parentId`. Switching between them calls `/api/sessions/[id]/context?leafId=`.

### Session files can be fully rewritten
`parentSession` in the header is **display metadata only** — has zero effect on chat content. Safe to `writeFileSync` the entire file (pi does this itself during migrations). Used when cascade-reparenting children on delete.

### ToolCall field normalization
Pi stores toolCall blocks as `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}` but `ToolCallContent` uses `{toolCallId, toolName, input}`. `normalizeToolCalls()` in `lib/normalize.ts` handles this — called in both `session-reader.ts` (file load) and `ChatWindow.handleAgentEvent()` (streaming).

### New session tool preset
Tool names are passed at session creation (`POST /api/agent/new` → `toolNames[]`). For existing sessions, the active preset is inferred on mount via `get_tools` → `getPresetFromTools()`. When tools are fully disabled (`toolNames = []`), `rpc-manager.ts` passes an empty tool allow-list and forces `agent.state.systemPrompt = ""` after startup/reload/resource discovery.

### Model defaults for new sessions
`GET /api/models` returns `defaultModel` read from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. `ChatWindow` pre-selects this on mount for new sessions. Explicit browser model/thinking selections are applied atomically during AgentSession construction, then `lib/startup-preferences.ts` persists their effective values without replaying `set_model`/`set_thinking_level`; implicit `enabledModels` fallbacks and thinking pins are not persisted.

### `enabledModels` scoping
The `enabledModels` setting uses pi's `--models` syntax: minimatch globs against `provider/modelId` or a bare `modelId`, fuzzy matching for non-glob patterns, and an optional `:thinkingLevel` suffix. Never compare those patterns as literal strings — `lib/model-scope.ts` delegates to the SDK's `resolveModelScopeWithDiagnostics()` so polykit-agent and the TUI agree on the visible model list, and falls back to all available models when patterns resolve to nothing. `startRpcSession()` resolves that scope before creating an AgentSession and passes the selected initial model, thinking pin, and SDK-native `scopedModels` atomically; `GET /api/models` reuses the helper only for selector data, `thinkingLevelPins`, and `modelScopeWarnings` display.

### SSE reconnect on page refresh mid-stream
On `ChatWindow` mount, `GET /api/agent/[id]` is called. If `state.isStreaming === true`, SSE is reconnected automatically. `thinkingLevel` and `isCompacting` are also synced from this response.

### Compaction SSE events
Newer pi emits `compaction_start` / `compaction_end`; older versions emitted `auto_compaction_start` / `auto_compaction_end`. `handleAgentEvent` accepts both sets to keep `isCompacting` in sync. Manual compact is a blocking POST — the button stays disabled until the response returns.

### Running state polling + reconciliation
- The sidebar polls `/api/agent/running` every 2.5 seconds while the tab is visible and pauses polling in background tabs. The session-list response remains the initial fallback.
- `useAgentSession` treats per-session SSE as primary for chat events and opens it before each prompt. `prompt_done` completes the current UI stage and notification immediately, but the idle SSE stays open for a 30-second grace window and is reused by the next prompt. `agent_start` cancels that close timer; `agent_settled` finishes extension-injected runs that have no wrapper-level `prompt_done` and starts a fresh grace window. Do not close on the first `agent_end`: retries, compaction, and extension-queued messages can continue the same logical prompt.
- While a run is active, `useAgentSession` periodically calls `GET /api/agent/[id]` and also reconciles on `visibilitychange`/`online`. This fixes missed terminal events from background tabs or half-open connections.
- Prompt runs use a monotonic run id; late SSE or slow reconciliation responses from an old run must be ignored so they cannot resurrect stale streaming bubbles.

### Worktrees and project grouping
- `lib/worktree.ts` resolves linked worktree top-levels back to the main repo `projectRoot`; `listAllSessions()` attaches that to each `SessionInfo` so all worktrees for one repo are grouped together in the sidebar.
- Worktree operations are served by `/api/worktrees` and guarded by the same allowed-root rules as other workspace-scoped services.
- New worktrees are created under `<repoRoot>-worktrees/<sanitized-branch>`. Existing branches are reused; otherwise `git worktree add -b` creates the branch.
- Removing a dirty worktree returns `409` with `{ dirty: true }` so the UI can ask before retrying with `force`.
- Sessions whose cwd points at a removed worktree are inferred back into the main project instead of becoming a phantom project row.

### Workspace path allow-list
- The Agent UI does not expose a project file browser, file viewer, file tabs, or `@` file autocomplete.
- `file-access.ts` still protects server-side workspace, plugin, skill, MCP, model, and worktree operations. Allowed roots come from session cwds, resolved project roots, `~/pi-cwd-*`, and roots explicitly added with `allowFileRoot()`.
- `/api/cwd/validate`, `/api/default-cwd`, and `/api/worktrees` register workspace roots for those server-side operations; this does not make a browser file listing available.

### Plugins and skills
- `/api/plugins` uses pi's `SettingsManager` + `DefaultPackageManager` for global/project package install, remove, update, enable, and disable. Disabling writes empty `extensions/skills/prompts/themes` arrays for that package entry.
- `/api/skills` uses `DefaultResourceLoader` so settings paths, package skills, and project `.agents/skills` are listed the same way the runtime sees them.
- Skill toggling edits only the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter key on the target `SKILL.md`; keep that surgical so user formatting survives.
- `/api/skills/install` shells through `npx skills add ... --agent pi`; project installs run with the selected cwd.

### Auth and model config
- `ModelsConfig` combines models from `~/.pi/agent/models.json` with provider auth status from pi's `AuthStorage`/`ModelRegistry`.
- Provider listing is capability-driven, never id-driven: `lib/provider-listing.ts` decides membership from `auth.apiKey.login` / `auth.oauth` plus the stored credential type, so dual-auth providers (anthropic and github-copilot today — which providers declare both changes between SDK releases, so never assume it from an id) appear exactly once and never fall through both lists (#309). `lib/provider-listing-runtime.ts` adapts `ModelRuntime` to those polykit-agent helpers.
- auth.json holds **one** credential per provider and `ModelRuntime.logout()` deletes whichever it is. The delete routes therefore use `removeStoredCredentialIfType()` to compare and delete under the same file lock used by pi's auth storage. `ModelsConfig` also refreshes *both* provider lists after any auth change — refreshing one leaves a dual-auth provider rendered twice.
- OAuth/device-code/manual-code flows are streamed by `GET /api/auth/login/[provider]`; manual code responses POST back with a short-lived token stored in `globalThis.__piLoginCallbacks`.
- API-key routes store and remove keys through `AuthStorage`. Status endpoints must never return the raw key.
- The model test route is `app/api/models-config/test/route.ts`; `app/api/models/test/` is not a real route.

### Completion sound
- `hooks/useAudio.ts` stores the toggle in `localStorage` as `pi-sound-enabled` and reuses one `AudioContext`.
- Browser autoplay policy means sound must be unlocked from a user gesture; `ChatInput` calls the unlock hook from interactive controls, and `ChatWindow` plays the tone from `onAgentEnd`.

### Exported session HTML
- `/api/sessions/[id]/export` delegates to pi's export helper, then patches recursive tree helpers in the generated HTML to iterative versions so very deep linear sessions do not overflow the browser call stack.

## Pi Session File Format

Location: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"...","cwd":"/path","parentSession":"/abs/path/to/parent.jsonl"}
{"type":"model_change","id":"<8hex>","parentId":null,"provider":"zenmux","modelId":"claude-sonnet-4-6","timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[...],...}}
{"type":"message","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","message":{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"...","content":[...]}}
{"type":"compaction","id":"<8hex>","parentId":"<8hex>","summary":"...","firstKeptEntryId":"<8hex>","tokensBefore":N}
{"type":"session_info","id":"...","parentId":"...","name":"user-defined name"}
```

`entryIds[]` in `SessionContext` is a parallel array to `messages[]` — maps each displayed message back to its `.jsonl` entry id, used for fork and navigate_tree calls.
